# Cpp-Pong
A basic console version of pong in C++, only works in windows unfortunately.

Player 1 (left) is controlled with W and S keys, while player 2 (right) is controlled with up arrow and down arrow.\n
There is currently no score limit or AI, although I might implement the AI soon.\n
Have fun!
